        <h1>Working Paper</h1>
        <h2>Employer Growth and Worker Reallocation (Job Market Paper)</h2>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
          This paper presents novel evidence from a matched employer-employee data set in the US, investigating a close connection between initial worker flow and dispersion of firm size over time. I find that fast-growing firms replace many workers early on while firms with slow growth do not, leading to a persistent and widening size gap between them. These empirical facts imply that the cleansing process at the firm level is central to understanding the dispersion of firm size. To fully account for the tight link between worker and job flow, I introduce a model in which an employer learns about their employees' productivity, replaces unproductive workers, and grows over the life cycle. Fast-growing firms not only hire more workers but have a better composition in the cross-sectional relationship. With this mechanism, the size of the gap is dictated by the persistence of firms' learning ability. This model explains why a firm's dynamism is affected by workers, and highlights the importance of labor market flexibility in firm growth.

        <h2>Employer Learning, Task Assignment, and Mismatch (available upon request)</h2>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
          How do employers learn about their worker’s productivity and if they are over- or under-qualified? Theoretically, employers assign a task to their employees based on their public information (e.g., their education level), but workers can send a private signal (e.g., mismatch) to their employer if the actual task is harder (or easier) than their observed level of human capital. Thus, the wage level among mismatched workers can be explained by an initial error in the task assignment of employers. Employer’s efforts to correct their worker’s wages result in unequal wage growth patterns among workers over time. Guided by theoretical predictions, this paper presents evidence from a unique data set on the wage effects of publicly observable match quality (objective mismatch) against match quality that is the workers’ private signal (subjective mismatch). Compared to objectively over-qualified workers, subjectively over-qualified workers have lower-than-expected initial wages, but they then rise more quickly with employer tenure. I also find that both objective and subjective mismatch are associated with persistent effects on wage levels and growth over the life cycle.
